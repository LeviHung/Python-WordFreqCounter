When I grow up
When I grow up,
I’ll ride a John Deere tractor.
I’ll hitch my wagon up.
My friends will climb inside.
Everyone will have such fun
On our special fall hayride.

When I grow up,
I’ll ride a John Deere tractor.
I’ll ride it on the farm.
I’ll ride it into town.
Everyone will smile and wave
as I ride it all around.
