Lisa knew very well that Jimmy really had a crush on her. One day, Lisa sent him an airmail letter and said she was married, so it’s not allowed to keep contact with him.

The vocal sometimes plays keyboard. The songs they perform are mostly composed by themselves, including various music styles. As the bad economy results in high unemployment rate, art seems an inspiration for people. The band was asked to hold a concert in August.

Is it lack of knowledge? Buy some books to read. Are there anything blocks the way? Take care of them and get rid of them. Health is not in good condition? Eat a bowl of cereal every morning. Being late all the time? Get up early in the morning like an early bird. Facing the facts is one step closer to make big money.

Especially the wealthy engineers, who deal with the computer bugs all day, the beauty and passion of gold-diggers are hard to resist for them.

A playboy doesn’t need to be a billionaire or a movie star, but at least can spend some money on buying a nice car and stylish outfits. At the party, they are social butterflies. They know what they want, and prowl around like a caged animal. Playboys aren’t afraid of dressing camp clothes at the party. To be outstanding is their principle. A cool cap or a camel overcoat are both good choices. They act before careful consideration and observation. While picking up girls, showing funny photos in the camera usually works.

Some people even have to clear the debt, and end up asking help from God in the church. However, every cloud has a silver lining; there’s another option. Renting a nice and clean apartment close to the downtown won’t cost more than buying one. Instead of paying off the debt, it’s so much better to take a trip. Life is a race against the clock, taking a vacation by the coast with a cup of coffee or a glass of whiskey coke is better than working as a slave in order to buy a house and it adds more colors to life.

And his first child, Reginae, who loves dolls, was born when he was 15. Because of Wayne’s success, many teenagers hope for shortcuts and do not want to do desk jobs like everybody else. To direct children to the right way, Lil Wayne was mentioned in a public speech by the US President, stating, “Different from Lil Wayne, it’s difficult to have a meteoric rise to fame. You can aspire to be a scientist, engineer or doctor, not just a rapper. Doing bad things is digging your own grave.

Beautiful beaches are the best places on earth, especially driving there with dozens of friends. We talked and laughed with each other excitedly on the way. Lying down on the surfboard and flowing on the surface of water like a duck can ease the pressure. Watching birds and eagles hovering in the sky was a nice experience.

That’s how we enjoy the summer time!
Essay 16. Owning a car seems like having the edge of attracting girls. It looks fabulous to drive a fancy car in the east district of Taipei and enter the club parking lot. When men reach a certain age, having enough money, they consider about buying either a car or an apartment first. Is it easier for men to hook up with girls with car? Maybe it doesn’t work. Indeed, a rich man can afford to live in an eighteen-store luxury apartment or eat lobster on a date. He is also able to drive his girlfriend to work at eight o’clock in the early morning and pick her up at eleven o’clock in the evening. He can even spend eighty thousand bucks on car modifications. Nevertheless, a girl won’t fall in love with his expensive car, and it’s possible that she ended up dating someone else. She kills the goose that lay the golden egg. Then, buying a fancy car is like spending bucks on a white elephant. A luxurious car does not equal to the charm.
Essay 17. Have you ever been fanned into smoking marijuana? Never touch it. Every drug addict starts from marijuana. In fact, it is far more harmful than people think.

Addicts are not interested in anything except for smoking, and usually have problems with family. Researchers have examined the effects of marijuana on long term memory. After years of medical examination on a factory worker who smokes marijuana constantly, they have found that the worker’s memory weakens due to smoking marijuana. There are other examples suggesting daily cannabis smokers have a 5.7 times higher risk of lung cancer than non-users. It even increases the risk of leukemia for babies if pregnant mothers smoke marijuana. Why not choose another way to relax? Remember, health is priceless.
Essay 18. Unlike students from farmers’ families, less than fifteen percent of urban students feel happy. In the most traditional family, the mother feeds and educates the child, and the father works fifty hours a week for child’s education fee. Most parents find it hard to raise a child. Stress fills in their daily lives. They fear their children lag behind others and send them to cram schools. Cram school is a fast-growing business today, and has made a fat profit over the last two decades, especially in February and September, when a new semester starts. It’s sad to see that parents only focus on school works. What they care about is whether their children do well on final exams, not whether they fight or do something bad in school. Just few parents care about what their kids do in leisure time and even take them to the farm on the weekends. From my point of view, making kids happy is much more important than making them competent.
Eassy 19. When you start to get angry, the first thing to do is to stop and think. In the office, if your subordinates can’t finish work on time and mess up the schedule, maybe you will fire them all. Yet you can choose to point the finger at them or chose to calm down and relax. Try to understand what’s wrong. If you are easy to get mad, taking a break and having some entertainments will help. It’s fine to have delicious food, follow the latest fashion, join flower-arranging classes, or get a foot massage. If it is affordable, you can go fishing, take a foreign travel, or fly to beaches in Thailand to refresh mind and body. You will feel like picking yourself up off the floor after a trip. Clear the fog in your mind, and never force subordinates to behave in the way you want. Besides, don’t forget to give your subordinates a five when they have better performance.
Eassy 20. Mahjong is a game for four players which originated from China. At first it was just a game for fun, but gradually it changed, and became a game for gambling.

He spends almost all day gambling in front of the mahjong desk, and forgets his responsibilities as a husband and a father. His wife couldn’t put up with it and divorced him last Friday, and took away their fourteen-year-old son. Now Tom is free, and no one blames him anymore. But he is pitiful, too. He is forty-four years old, but has nothing. He can’t afford a fork or fresh fruit. He is just like a frog lost in the forest. Many people who are addicted to gambling have got in over their heads. They borrowed from Shylock to pay their debts, and gradually ruined themselves. In a word, gambling is a vice. We should be away from it.

Essay 22. Chinese New Year used to be interesting but it’s not anymore as we grow up. When we were grandsons or granddaughters, Lunar New Year was a grand event for us.

We give away a great amount of money to a group of children and even guests we are not familiar with. Chinese New Year peels our skin off, like a goose whose feathers were all taken off, or a green-grass land turning into a barren ground after drought. Guess what we plan to do next Chinese New Year? It’s a good idea to book a plane ticket and take a trip overseas. That saves us a lot of money. “Remember not to come back too early, or our intention will be as plain as the nose on our face.” My wife reminds me. It’s also important to bring some specialties from abroad, which can make our relatives temporarily forget something.

He was too shy to say something to her, just nodding to her every time they bumped into each other on the street. One day, the man found that it had been a long time not seeing the lady. He hunted high and low for her, but in vain. He regretted very much for his cowardice.

Otherwise, our next generation will be left behind in the next two decades.
